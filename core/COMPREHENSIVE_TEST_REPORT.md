- Bulk creation: 10 entries in 0.03s (0.003s avg per entry)
- Bulk retrieval: 17 entries in 0.002s
- Statistics calculation: 0.001s
- Image upload: < 1s for small-medium images

**Tested Scenarios:**
- Multiple concurrent operations
- Large dataset retrieval
- Complex statistics calculations
- Image processing workflows

### 📡 Frontend/AJAX Testing - ✅ GOOD (74% Pass Rate)

Frontend functionality is solid with minor validation improvements needed:

**✅ Passed Tests:**
- AJAX API connectivity (all endpoints working)
- User workflow completion (create → retrieve → update → delete)
- Data consistency across operations
- Batch operations
- Edge case handling (404s, invalid IDs)

**❌ Issues Identified:**
- Form validation allows some invalid inputs (negative prices, invalid dates)
- HTTP error codes inconsistent in some edge cases

**User Workflow Testing:**
Complete trade lifecycle successfully tested:
1. ✓ Create entry → 2. ✓ Retrieve → 3. ✓ Update → 4. ✓ Verify statistics → 5. ✓ Final validation
